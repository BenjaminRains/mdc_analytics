# Payment Data Quality Observations

## Data Integrity Checks

### 1. Payment-Split Relationship
- **Validation**: All 5,658 payments successfully joined to their splits
- **Status**: âœ… No missing or orphaned records
- **Risk**: Low - Core relationships are maintained properly

### 2. Split Amount Validation
- **Observation**: Split amounts should sum to payment amount
- **Tolerance**: Difference <= 0.01
- **Issues Found**:
  - 23 payments with split sum mismatches
  - Most differences due to rounding
  - No systematic pattern identified

### 3. High Split Count Cases
- **Normal Range**: 1-3 splits (76.7% of payments)
- **Warning Threshold**: >15 splits per payment
- **Issues Found**:
  - 41 payments with abnormal split patterns
  - All identified cases are legitimate insurance payments
  - No data quality concerns, but requires monitoring

### 4. Payment Date Integrity
- **Validation**: Payment dates must be valid for AR calculations
- **Issues Found**:

  - 45 splits with $0.00 amount
  - May indicate data entry errors or legitimate adjustments
  - Requires manual review

### 7. Excessive Split Patterns (July-December 2024)
- **Critical Issue Identified**: Beginning July 2024
  - Systematic pattern of excessive splits
  - 992 payments affected across 29 days
  - 250,898 suspicious splits generated
  - Peak activity: November 1, 2024 (457.6 splits per payment)
  - 98.3% of suspicious payments are Type 0 transfers
  - 92.8% of suspicious payments have negative split amounts

- **Pattern Details**:
  - 5 specific procedures showing identical patterns
  - Claims affected: 2536, 2542, 6519
  - Procedures: 61980, 108306, 61979, 108309, 95856
  - 10,348 splits per procedure
  - Symmetric amounts (-$14,530 to +$14,530)
  - All $0 net transfer payments
  - Concentrated in 6-day period (Oct 30 - Nov 5, 2024)

- **Pattern Evolution**:
  - Normal operation (Jan-Jun 2024): 2-10 splits per payment
  - Initial anomalies (Jul 2024): Occasional spikes up to 40 splits per payment
  - Problem escalation (Aug-Oct 2024): Regular spikes of 100-400 splits per payment
  - Peak anomaly (Nov 1, 2024): 457.6 splits per payment
  - Post-policy change (Nov 15-Dec 2024): Continued high split counts (avg 35.75)

- **Top Payment-Split Discrepancies**:
  1. Payment #915434: $0.00 payment, $-859,064.88 splits, $859,064.88 difference (4,946 splits)
  2. Payment #910740: $49,500.00 payment, $891,000.00 splits, $841,500.00 difference (36 splits)
  3. Payment #915873: $0.00 payment, $-804,328.20 splits, $804,328.20 difference (3,564 splits)
  4. Payment #910580: $47,000.00 payment, $846,000.00 splits, $799,000.00 difference (18 splits)
  5. Payment #913762: $43,900.00 payment, $790,200.00 splits, $746,300.00 difference (18 splits)

### 8. "Hidden Splits" Policy Impact (November 2024)
- **Policy Change Assessment**:
  - Policy implemented November 15, 2024
  - Intended to ensure all payments account for every dollar spent
  - Post-implementation metrics:
    - Suspicious days **increased** from 7.6% pre-policy to 27.3% post-policy
    - Average splits per payment **increased by 71.7%** (from 20.81 to 35.75)
    - December 2024 shows **4 suspicious days** with a maximum of 278.9 splits per payment
    - 9.7% of December payments have >100 splits
    - 67.7% of December payments show significant split differences

- **Impact Assessment**:
  - Policy change has altered but not resolved the underlying issue
  - Problem appears to have worsened after implementation
  - Different pattern but similar magnitude of issues

### 9. Technical Root Cause Analysis

The pattern strongly suggests a **system processing error specific to transfer payments**. Evidence points to:

1. **Recursive Split Generation**: When processing Type 0 transfers with $0 amounts, the system appears to be creating recursive or duplicate splits.

2. **Payment-Split Accounting Disconnect**: The system is recording negative split amounts for zero-value payments, creating massive discrepancies.

3. **Configuration Change**: The clear start date (July 1, 2024) suggests a system change or upgrade occurred that introduced this behavior.

4. **Policy Change Complication**: The "hidden splits" policy implementation in November appears to have exacerbated rather than resolved the issue.

#### Most Likely Technical Scenario

Based on the evidence, we believe this sequence of events occurred:

1. **July 2024 Code Change**: A code change introduced a bug in Type 0 transfer processing where the system recursively creates splits for $0 amount payments.

2. **November "Hidden Splits" Solution**: Instead of fixing the root issue, stakeholders implemented a workaround to "hide" these splits from accounting processes.

3. **Worsened Condition**: The workaround either:
   - Created additional splits as part of its hiding mechanism
   - Made the recursive bug worse
   - Added a second layer of processing that duplicates records

4. **False Resolution**: While the accounting figures correctly net to zero (appearing "fixed" from a financial perspective), the underlying database is now even more bloated with phantom splits.

5. **Hard-Coded Limit**: The exact same pattern (10,348 splits) appearing across different procedures strongly indicates a code-level issue - likely a recursion bug with a maximum iteration limit of approximately 10,348.

The "hidden splits" approach has seemingly created a situation where the accounting system can ignore these excess splits, but the technical debt continues to accumulate in the database.

### 10. Business Impact Assessment

1. **No Direct Financial Impact**:
   - All transfers net to $0 as intended
   - Original claim amounts preserved
   - Final accounting is correct
   - Staff able to complete intended transfers
   - No lost or misallocated money

2. **Significant System Inefficiency**:
   - Excessive split generation (250,898+ suspicious splits)
   - Unnecessarily large split amounts
   - Progressive escalation pattern
   - Database bloat from extra records
   - Potential performance impacts

### 11. Updated Monitoring Thresholds
- **Split Count Alerts**:
  - Warning: >100 splits per procedure
  - Critical: >1000 splits per procedure
  - Immediate review: >10000 splits per procedure

- **Pattern Detection**:
  - Identical split counts across procedures
  - Symmetric negative/positive amounts
  - High volume in short timeframe
  - Multiple procedures showing same pattern

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions
- **Implement Emergency Filter**: Create validation rule to prevent payments with >20 splits from automatic processing
- **Reassess "Hidden Splits" Implementation**: Review how the November policy change was technically implemented
- **Isolate Type 0 Transfers**: Add extra validation specifically for Type 0 payments with $0 amounts

### 2. System Corrections
- **Review Code Changes**: Examine any payment processing code changes implemented before July 1, 2024
- **Fix Split Logic**: Correct the logic that's allowing negative split amounts for zero-value payments
- **Implement Validation Rules**: 
  - Total split amount must equal payment amount
  - Maximum splits per payment should be capped (perhaps at 20)
  - Payment-type specific validation rules

### 3. Data Entry Controls
- Add validation for future dates
- Enforce non-NULL payment dates
- Add warning for zero-amount transactions
- Implement split amount validation at entry

### 4. Monitoring & Prevention
- **Develop Monitoring Dashboard**: Create daily visualization of split patterns to quickly identify anomalies
- **Add System Alerts**: Implement automatic notifications when payments exceed split thresholds
- **Regular Data Quality Checks**: Establish weekly review of split metrics to catch emerging issues

## Next Steps
1. Implement automated validation checks
2. Create monitoring dashboard
3. Document legitimate exception cases
4. Review zero-amount transaction handling
5. Update AR calculation logic for date handling
6. Develop remediation plan for existing excessive split issues
