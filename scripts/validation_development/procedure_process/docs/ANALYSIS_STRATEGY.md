# Procedure Log Analysis Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines our strategy for analyzing procedure log data, documenting key findings, and establishing foundations for treatment journey and patient journey modeling.

## Scope and Related Tables

### Primary Focus
The `procedurelog` table is a core transactional table in OpenDental that captures the fundamental business operations of a dental clinic. Each record represents a dental procedure, whether planned, completed, or otherwise dispositioned. This analysis primarily focuses on validating and understanding the procedure log data itself.

### Related Table Integration
While maintaining focus on procedure log validation, this analysis necessarily touches on several related tables:

- **Payment & Financial**
  - `paysplit`: Direct payment allocations
  - `claimproc`: Insurance payments and estimates
  - Fee schedules and adjustments

- **Treatment Planning**
  - `proctp`: Treatment planned procedures
  - `treatplan`: Treatment plan headers
  - *Note: Detailed treatment planning validation is covered in the treatment_plan_validation directory*

- **Clinical Context**
  - `perioexam`: Periodontal examination records
  - `periomeasure`: Detailed perio measurements
  - *Note: Detailed perio analysis is covered in treatment_plan_validation*

- **Scheduling**
  - `appointment`: Procedure scheduling and execution
  - Provider scheduling and availability

- **Provider Context**
  - Provider assignments and performance metrics
  - Clinical role relationships

### Analysis Boundaries
- Primary validation focuses on procedure log integrity
- Related table analysis limited to direct procedure relationships
- Detailed analysis of related systems (treatment planning, perio, etc.) deferred to respective validation directories
- Payment analysis focused on procedure-payment relationships rather than detailed financial reconciliation

## Initial Data Quality Assessment

### Date Field Completeness (2024 Dataset)
- **ProcDate**: 100% complete (0% NaT)
  - Primary temporal anchor for procedure events
  - Required field for all procedures
  
- **DateComplete**: 51.81% complete (48.19% NaT)
  - Missing for ~half of procedures
  - Hypothesis: Corresponds to non-completed procedures
  - Key for treatment completion analysis
  
- **AptDateTime**: 51.99% complete (48.01% NaT)
  - Strong correlation with DateComplete
  - Critical for appointment-procedure relationship analysis
  
- **TreatPlanDate**: 1.37% complete (98.63% NaT)
  - Very low completion rate
  - Investigation needed: Treatment planning process gaps?
  
- **PerioExamDate**: 55.53% complete (44.47% NaT)
  - Moderate completion rate
  - Need to validate against procedure types requiring perio exams

## Analysis Dimensions

### 1. Procedure Lifecycle Analysis
- Status transitions
- Time-to-completion patterns
- Treatment plan to completion flow
- Appointment scheduling patterns

### 2. Clinical Patterns
- Procedure code distributions
- Provider patterns
- Specialty-specific workflows
- Treatment bundling patterns

### 3. Financial Patterns
- Fee distributions
- Payment completion rates
- Insurance vs. direct payment patterns
- Time-to-payment analysis

### 4. Patient Journey Integration Points
- Treatment sequencing
- Appointment patterns
- Return visit intervals
- Treatment plan adherence

### 5. Data Quality Validation
- Status consistency checks
- Date field logical validation
- Fee and payment validation
- Code usage validation

## Key Business Logic Questions

1. **Treatment Planning Process**
- Why is TreatPlanDate completion rate so low?
- How are treatment plans being documented?
- What defines a properly planned procedure?

2. **Procedure Status Workflow**
- What are valid status transitions?
- How are completed procedures validated?
- What triggers status changes?

3. **Appointment Integration**
- How are procedures linked to appointments?
- What procedures require appointments?
- How are walk-ins handled?

4. **Financial Integration**
- How are fees assigned?
- What drives payment splitting?
- How are insurance estimates handled?

## Next Steps

### Immediate Analysis Priorities
1. [ ] Status distribution analysis
2. [ ] Completion rate patterns
3. [ ] Appointment linkage validation
4. [ ] Treatment plan documentation review

### Data Quality Improvements
1. [ ] Identify critical missing data patterns
2. [ ] Document validation rules
3. [ ] Propose data collection improvements

### Journey Model Integration
1. [ ] Define procedure grouping logic
2. [ ] Establish temporal patterns
3. [ ] Map procedure dependencies
4. [ ] Document clinical workflows

## Notes for Journey Modeling

### Treatment Journey Considerations
- Procedure sequencing rules
- Clinical dependencies
- Standard of care patterns
- Treatment plan adherence metrics

### Patient Journey Integration
- First visit patterns
- Return visit triggers
- Treatment acceptance patterns
- Long-term care patterns

## Open Questions
1. How are treatment plans being documented outside of TreatPlanDate?
2. What drives the correlation between DateComplete and AptDateTime?
3. Are there procedures that should/shouldn't require appointments?
4. How do we validate proper treatment planning?

## Updates and Findings
(To be updated as analysis progresses)

### [YYYY-MM-DD] Initial Analysis
- Documented baseline date field completion rates
- Identified treatment planning documentation gap
- Found strong correlation between completion and appointment dates
