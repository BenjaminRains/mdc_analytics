# Insurance Claim Validation Analysis 2024

## Overview
This report summarizes the findings from the insurance claim validation analysis conducted in 2024.

## Key Findings

### Fee Pattern Analysis
- High concentration of specific fee amounts: $330, $1950, $1288, $530, $310
- Significant zero payment rates:
  - $530: 81.7% zero payments
  - $1950: 68.7% zero payments
  - $1288: 50.3% zero payments

### Sequence Analysis
- Strong fee transition patterns identified:
  - $330 -> $1950 sequences
  - $1288 -> $310 alternating pattern
- High zero-payment correlation with specific transitions
- Patient-specific fee transition patterns

### High-Risk Patterns
1. Patient 20760:
   - 30 total claims
   - 22 claims at $330 (64% zero payments)
   - 8 claims at $1950 (100% zero payments)
   - 28 rapid claims (<=7 days)

2. Patient 20912:
   - 26 total claims
   - 16 claims at $330 (62% zero payments)
   - 10 claims at $1950 (100% zero payments)
   - 24 rapid claims (<=7 days)

### Batch Processing Patterns
- High rate of same-day claims
- Strong clustering of zero payments
- Fee-specific batch submission patterns

## Recommendations
1. Investigate high-risk patient patterns
2. Review batch submission processes
3. Analyze fee-specific payment patterns
4. Implement enhanced monitoring for rapid claim sequences
