## Recommendations

### 1. Optimal Batch Structure
- Submit 2-3 claims per batch
- Keep within 3 unique fees per batch
- Maintain similar-value procedures together
- Separate high-value claims (>$1000)

### 2. Timing Guidelines
- Maximum 3 same-day claims
- Space out high-value submissions
- Allow 1-2 days between batches
- Balance urgent claim needs

### 3. Risk Mitigation
- Split batches larger than 4 claims
- Separate mixed-fee submissions
- Isolate high-value procedures
- Group within $500 ranges

## Examples of Optimal Batching

### Successful Combinations
1. Low-Value Batch:
   - $109 procedure
   - $76 procedure
   - $60 procedure
   - Success Rate: 78%

2. Medium-Value Batch:
   - $330 procedure
   - $310 procedure
   - Success Rate: 82%

3. High-Value Batch:
   - $1,950 procedure (submitted alone)
   - Success Rate: 91%

### Problematic Combinations to Avoid
1. Mixed-Value Batch:
   - $1,288 procedure
   - $310 procedure
   - $76 procedure
   - $31 procedure
   - Result: 46% zero payment rate

2. Oversized Batch:
   - Six $330 procedures
   - Result: 73% zero payment rate

3. High/Low Mix:
   - $1,950 procedure
   - $109 procedure
   - $60 procedure
   - Result: 84% underpayment rate

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Immediate Actions
- Review current batching practices
- Implement size limits (maximum 4 claims)
- Separate high-value claims
- Establish timing guidelines

### 2. Monitoring Requirements
- Track batch success rates
- Monitor risk indicators
- Measure timing compliance
- Validate fee groupings

### 3. Process Improvements
- Optimize batch creation
- Implement fee grouping
- Manage submission timing
- Track success patterns

## Conclusion
Proper batch submission strategies can significantly improve claim payment success rates. Focus should be placed on maintaining appropriate batch sizes, grouping similar-value procedures, and following recommended timing guidelines. The data shows that following these guidelines can increase success rates from as low as 27% to as high as 91%.

### Key Success Metrics
- Target payment ratio: >70%
- Target zero payment rate: <20%
