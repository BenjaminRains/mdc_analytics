# Payment Split Pattern Analysis

## Executive Summary
We've identified an abnormal pattern of payment splits in the system, concentrated around three specific claims. While these splits show unusual systematic behavior that deviates from normal patterns, they do not appear to have any negative business impact beyond system inefficiency.

## The Pattern
- Three claims (2536, 2542, 6519) are generating excessive payment splits
- Each affected procedure has exactly 10,348 splits
- All splits are symmetrical (-$14,530 to +$14,530)
- Activity concentrated in 6-day period (Oct 30 - Nov 5, 2024)
- All transfers net to $0 as intended

## Evidence in the Data

### 1. Normal Transfer Payment Pattern
Example PayNum: 917342 (Dec 27, 2024)
- 12 splits total
- 2.0 splits per procedure
- 6 procedures involved
- Typical business transaction pattern

### 2. Abnormal Transfer Pattern
Example PayNum: 915884 (Nov 1, 2024)
- 420 splits
- 140 splits per procedure
- Only 3 procedures
- All from problem claims (2536, 2542, 6519)
- Still nets to $0 as intended

### 3. Scale of System Impact
- 5 specific procedures affected:
  * ClaimNum 2536: Procs 61980, 108306 ($122.20 transfer)
  * ClaimNum 2542: Procs 61979, 108309 ($189.20 transfer)
  * ClaimNum 6519: Proc 95856 ($305.00 transfer)
- Each procedure shows identical pattern:
  * 492 payments involved
  * 10,348 splits each
  * 6 active days
  * Symmetric amounts
  * Correct net transfer amounts

### 4. Staff Activity Analysis

#### Staff Member SW
- Most frequent transfer initiator
- Consistent note format: "Income transfer. -SW"
- Additional note examples:
  * "Adjustment on account. SW"
  * "Income transfer adj. SW"
  * "Reallocation and income transfer of $17. -SW"
- Characteristics:
  * Detailed payment notes
  * Specific amount mentions in notes
  * Mix of adjustments and transfers
  * Higher volume of transactions
  * Consistent signature format "-SW"

#### Staff Member CD
- Secondary transfer initiator
- Variable note format: "INCOME TRANSFER CD"
- Note variations:
  * "income transfer.-cd"
  * "income transfer.- CD"
  * "INCOME TRANSFER. CD"
- Characteristics:
  * Less detailed notes
  * Inconsistent capitalization
  * Varied signature format (CD, cd, -cd)
  * Larger individual amounts
  * Fewer but larger batch transfers

### 5. System Behavior Progression (Oct 30)

Time Period | Split Range | Typical Split Count
-----------+---------------------+-------------------
Early Day | -$100 to +$100 | 10-50 splits
Mid-Day | -$300 to +$300 | 100-200 splits
Late Day | -$1,000 to +$1,000 | 200-400 splits
Peak (Nov 1)| -$14,530 to +$14,530| 10,348 splits

## Key Findings
1. No Business Impact:
   - All transfers net to $0 as intended
   - Original claim amounts preserved
   - Final accounting is correct
   - Staff able to complete intended transfers
   - No lost or misallocated money

2. System Inefficiency:
   - Excessive split generation (51,740 total splits)
   - Unnecessarily large split amounts
   - Progressive escalation pattern
   - Identical behavior across procedures
   - Database bloat from extra records

3. Staff Workflow:
   - Both staff members encountered same pattern
   - Normal transfer work generated abnormal splits
   - No apparent impact on transfer completion
   - System still achieved intended results

## Recommendations
1. System Optimization:
   - Review transfer payment logic
   - Implement reasonable split count limits
   - Add monitoring for unusual split patterns
   - Optimize database storage for splits
2. Documentation:
   - Document normal vs abnormal patterns
   - Update transfer process documentation
   - Create performance monitoring guidelines
3. Future Prevention:
   - Add system alerts for high split volumes
   - Regular monitoring of split patterns
   - Performance impact assessment of splits
