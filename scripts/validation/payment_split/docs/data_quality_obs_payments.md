# Payment Data Quality Observations

## Data Integrity Checks

### 1. Payment-Split Relationship
- **Validation**: All 5,658 payments successfully joined to their splits
- **Status**: âœ… No missing or orphaned records
- **Risk**: Low - Core relationships are maintained properly

### 2. Split Amount Validation
- **Observation**: Split amounts should sum to payment amount
- **Tolerance**: Difference <= 0.01
- **Issues Found**:
  - 23 payments with split sum mismatches
  - Most differences due to rounding
  - No systematic pattern identified

### 3. High Split Count Cases
- **Normal Range**: 1-3 splits (76.7% of payments)
- **Warning Threshold**: >15 splits per payment
- **Issues Found**:
  - 41 payments with abnormal split patterns
  - All identified cases are legitimate insurance payments
  - No data quality concerns, but requires monitoring

### 4. Payment Date Integrity
- **Validation**: Payment dates must be valid for AR calculations
- **Issues Found**:
  - 12 payments dated in future
  - 3 payments with invalid dates (NULL)
  - Affects AR reporting accuracy

### 5. Insurance Payment Validation
- **Multiple Claims Per Procedure**:
  - 41 payments show multiple claim relationships
  - Maximum 2 claims per procedure observed
  - 78% are Type 71 insurance payments
  - All cases verified as legitimate

### 6. Zero Amount Transactions
- **Issues Found**:
  - 89 payments with $0.00 amount
  - 45 splits with $0.00 amount
  - May indicate data entry errors or legitimate adjustments
  - Requires manual review

## Recommendations

### 1. Data Entry Controls
- Add validation for future dates
- Enforce non-NULL payment dates
- Add warning for zero-amount transactions
- Implement split amount validation at entry

### 2. Monitoring Requirements
- Track high split count payments
- Monitor insurance payment patterns
- Review zero-amount transactions
- Validate split amount totals

### 3. Reporting Considerations
- Flag future-dated payments in AR calculations
- Document legitimate multiple claim scenarios
- Note split amount tolerance in financial reports
- Track payment pattern distributions

### 4. Process Improvements
- Add split amount validation checks
- Implement date range controls
- Document multiple claim scenarios
- Add zero-amount transaction reviews

## Next Steps
1. Implement automated validation checks
2. Create monitoring dashboard
3. Document legitimate exception cases
4. Review zero-amount transaction handling
5. Update AR calculation logic for date handling
