# Insurance Validation Analysis Strategy

## Analysis Boundaries
- Primary validation focuses on insurance plan integrity and claim processing
- Related table analysis limited to direct insurance relationships
- Detailed analysis of related systems (procedure log, patient accounts) deferred to respective validation directories
- Payment analysis focused on insurance claim payments and write-offs

## Core Analysis Areas

### 1. Insurance Plan Validation
- Plan status and effective dates
- Carrier relationships
- Subscriber information
- Coverage terms and limitations
- Plan type classification

### 2. Claims Processing Analysis
- Claim submission workflow
- Processing status tracking
- Turnaround time metrics
- Error and rejection patterns
- Resubmission analysis

### 3. Payment Reconciliation
- Payment posting accuracy
- Write-off validation
- Payment splitting patterns
- Outstanding balance tracking
- Adjustment analysis

### 4. Insurance Verification
- Verification status tracking
- Expiration monitoring
- Coverage confirmation patterns
- Verification frequency analysis
- Data completeness checks

### 5. Carrier Performance Metrics
- Claims processing speed
- Payment accuracy
- Denial patterns
- Communication effectiveness
- Electronic filing success rates

## Validation Queries and CTEs

### Core Validation Queries

1. **Plan and Coverage Analysis**
   - `plan_status.sql`: Insurance plan status distribution
   - `coverage_dates.sql`: Coverage date validation
   - `subscriber_validation.sql`: Subscriber relationship analysis
   - `plan_utilization.sql`: Plan usage patterns

2. **Claims Analysis**
   - `claim_status_distribution.sql`: Claim status patterns
   - `claim_lifecycle.sql`: Processing timeline analysis
   - `claim_errors.sql`: Error pattern identification
   - `submission_patterns.sql`: Submission and resubmission flows

3. **Payment Analysis**
   - `payment_accuracy.sql`: Payment vs. expected amount
   - `writeoff_patterns.sql`: Write-off analysis
   - `payment_posting.sql`: Payment posting validation
   - `outstanding_claims.sql`: Unpaid claims tracking

4. **Verification Analysis**
   - `verification_status.sql`: Current verification states
   - `verification_expiration.sql`: Expiration tracking
   - `verification_gaps.sql`: Coverage gap analysis
   - `verification_frequency.sql`: Verification pattern analysis

5. **Carrier Analysis**
   - `carrier_performance.sql`: Processing time metrics
   - `carrier_payment_patterns.sql`: Payment behavior analysis
   - `carrier_denial_rates.sql`: Denial pattern analysis
   - `electronic_filing_success.sql`: E-filing effectiveness

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
The validation queries will utilize a set of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) that encapsulate core business logic and data transformations. These CTEs will provide reusable components for:
- Plan status determination
- Coverage period validation
- Payment calculations
- Verification status evaluation
- Claim status tracking
- Carrier performance metrics

*Detailed CTE documentation will be maintained in `CTE_DOCUMENTATION.md`*

## Validation Output Structure
Each query will produce a CSV file for analysis in:
- Jupyter notebooks
- Reporting tools
- Data quality dashboards

## Key Validation Questions

### Plan Integrity
- Are insurance plans properly configured with valid dates?
- Do subscriber relationships match plan types?
- Are coverage terms properly documented?
- Are plan limitations correctly applied?

### Claims Processing
- What is the distribution of claim statuses?
- Are claims being processed within expected timeframes?
- Are rejection patterns indicating systematic issues?
- Is resubmission workflow effective?

### Payment Validation
- Are payments being posted accurately?
- Do write-offs follow policy guidelines?
- Are payment splits handled correctly?
- Are outstanding balances properly tracked?

### Verification Process
- Are verifications current and complete?
- Are expiration dates being monitored?
- Are coverage gaps being identified?
- Is verification frequency adequate?

### Carrier Effectiveness
- Which carriers have the best/worst processing times?
- Are denial rates within acceptable ranges?
- Is electronic filing working effectively?
- Are carrier communications timely?

## Implementation Notes
1. Query performance optimization through proper indexing
2. Date range parameterization for flexible analysis periods
3. Error handling for edge cases and data anomalies
4. Output formatting for consistent reporting
5. Integration with existing validation frameworks
