 * Insurance Claim Processing and Payments Validation â€“ Unified Output
 *
 * Output File Naming Convention:
 * Format: ins_claim_validation_2024_{datasource}.csv
 * Example: ins_claim_validation_2024_prod.csv
 *          ins_claim_validation_2024_test.csv
 * 
 * Location: scripts/validation/data/
 * Base Path: {project_root}/scripts/validation/data/
 * Full Path Example: C:/Users/rains/mdc_analytics/scripts/validation/data/
 *
 * File Structure:
 * - Encoding: UTF-8
 * - Delimiter: comma (,)
 * - Headers: Yes (first row)
 * - Date Format: YYYY-MM-DD
 * 
 * Purpose:
 *  - Validate if claims are linked to active insurance plans.
 *  - Identify claims with unverified insurance information.
 *  - Match procedures to claims and analyze claim-to-payment relationships.
 *  - Analyze insurance plans and carriers.
 *
 * Time Period: 2024 calendar year.
 *
 * Output Format:
 * CSV file with 10 columns, each row represents one validation record:
 
 * 
 * 1. OutputSection (VARCHAR): Analysis category
 *    Values: 
 *    - "Active Insurance Plan"
 *    - "Unverified Insurance Info"
 *    - "Claim Payment Matching"
 *    - "Plan and Carrier Analysis"
 *
 * 2. GroupLabel (VARCHAR): Context identifier
 *    Format varies by section:
 *    - Active Insurance: "Claim {ClaimNum} ({plan_status})"
 *    - Unverified: "Claim {ClaimNum}"
 *    - Payment Matching: "Proc {ProcNum}"
 *    - Carrier Analysis: "Carrier {CarrierNum} - {CarrierName}"
 *
 * 3-10. Metric1-8 (VARCHAR): Section-specific metrics
 *    Active Insurance Plan section:
 *    - Metric1: PatNum
 *    - Metric2: PlanNum
 *    - Metric3: CarrierNum
 *    - Metric4: DateEffective (when insurance coverage begins)
 *    - Metric5: DateTerm (when ins coverage ends '0001-01-01' means open-ended)
 *    - Metric6: plan_status - Indicates if claim date falls within valid insurance coverage:
 *        'Valid': When ALL of these are true:
 *          - DateService >= DateEffective
 *          - DateService <= DateTerm (or plan is open-ended)
 *          - For open-ended plans (DateTerm = '0001-01-01'), treated as valid through '9999-12-31'
 *        'Invalid': When ANY of these are true:
 *          - DateService < DateEffective
 *          - DateService > DateTerm (for plans with specific end dates)
 *          - DateService outside the plan's effective coverage period
 *    - Metric7: NULL
 *    - Metric8: NULL
 *
 *    Unverified Insurance section:
 *    - Metric1: PatNum
 *    - Metric2: DateLastVerified
 *    - Metric3: days_since_verification
 *    - Metric4: verification_status
 *    - Metric5-8: NULL
 *
 *    Claim Payment Matching section:
 *    - Metric1: ClaimNum
 *    - Metric2: InsPayAmt (amount paid by insurance)
 *    - Metric3: ProcFee (Original proc fee from procedurelog)
 *    - Metric4: DedApplied (deductible applied to the claim)
 *    - Metric5: WriteOff (write-off amount)
 *    - Metric6: total_accounted (sum of InsPayAmt, DedApplied, WriteOff)
 *    - Metric7: unaccounted_amount (difference between ProcFee and total_accounted)
 *    - Metric8: payment_status (Underpaid, Balanced, Overpaid)
 *
 *    Plan and Carrier Analysis section:
 *    - Metric1: active_plans (number of active plans)
 *    - Metric2: total_claims (total claims processed by the carrier)
 *    - Metric3: unique_patients 
 *    - Metric4: avg_days_to_payment
 *    - Metric5: total_payments
 *    - Metric6: total_writeoffs
 *    - Metric7: total_deductibles
 *    - Metric8: unverified_claims (number of claims that have not been verified)
 *
 * Expected Validation Ranges:
 * - days_since_verification: 0-365 (normal), >365 (flag)
 * - unaccounted_amount: Should be 0 (balanced)
 * - avg_days_to_payment: 0-90 (normal), >90 (flag)
 *
 * Sort Order:
 * - Primary: OutputSection
 * - Secondary: GroupLabel
 *
 * Example Output Row:
 * "Active Insurance Plan","Claim 12345 (Valid)","1001","2001","3001","2024-01-01","2024-12-31","Valid","",""

/*
 * Insurance Claim Processing and Payments Validation
 * 
 * Date Handling:
 * - 0001-01-01: Valid placeholder date, indicates:
 *   * No termination date set (DateTerm)
 *   * Open-ended coverage
 *   * Default date when not specified
 * 
 * Date Validation Rules:
 * - DateEffective: 
 *   * Can be any valid date
 *   * Should be <= DateService for valid claims
 *   * 0001-01-01 might indicate data entry issue
 * 
 * - DateTerm:
 *   * Can be 0001-01-01 (open-ended/no termination)
 *   * Should be >= DateEffective if set
 *   * Future dates are valid
 * 
 * - DateService:
 *   * Must be real date (not 0001-01-01)
 *   * Must be within 2024 for this analysis
 *   * Used as reference point for validation
