# Procedure Log Analysis Strategy

### Analysis Boundaries
- Primary validation focuses on procedure log integrity
- Related table analysis limited to direct procedure relationships
- Detailed analysis of related systems (treatment planning, perio, etc.) deferred to respective validation directories
- Payment analysis focused on procedure-payment relationships rather than detailed financial reconciliation

## Validation Queries and CTEs

### Export Script
The `export_procedurelog_validation.py` script orchestrates the validation process by running a series of SQL queries that analyze different aspects of the procedure log data. Each query is designed to validate specific aspects of the data and export results for further analysis.

### Core Validation Queries

1. **Summary and Base Statistics**
   - `summary.sql`: Overall procedure data summary
   - `base_counts.sql`: Fundamental counts and statistics
   - `temporal_patterns.sql`: Month-by-month analytics

2. **Procedure Relationships**
   - `bundled_procedures.sql`: Commonly performed procedure combinations
   - `bundle_size_payment_analysis.sql`: Payment patterns by bundle size
   - `appointment_overlap.sql`: Procedure-appointment relationships

3. **Status Analysis**
   - `status_distribution.sql`: Procedure status code patterns
   - `status_transitions.sql`: Status transition flows
   - `edge_cases.sql`: Anomaly detection

4. **Financial Validation**
   - `fee_relationship_analysis.sql`: Fee-payment relationships
   - `fee_validation.sql`: Fee range and category analysis
   - `payment_metrics.sql`: Payment ratio analysis
   - `procedure_payment_links.sql`: Procedure-payment validation
   - `split_patterns.sql`: Insurance vs direct payment analysis
   - `monthly_unpaid.sql`: Unpaid procedures tracking

5. **Clinical Analysis**
   - `code_distribution.sql`: Procedure code patterns
   - `provider_performance.sql`: Provider metrics
   - `procedures_raw.sql`: Comprehensive procedure context

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
The validation queries utilize a set of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) that encapsulate core business logic and data transformations. These CTEs provide reusable components for:
- Data filtering and standardization
- Payment calculations
- Success criteria evaluation
- Relationship mapping

*Detailed CTE documentation can be found in `CTE_DOCUMENTATION.md`*

### Validation Output Structure
Each query produces a CSV file for analysis in:
- Jupyter notebooks
- Reporting tools
- Data quality dashboards
