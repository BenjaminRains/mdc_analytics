# ProcedureLog Data Quality Observations

This document records data quality observations identified during validation of the procedurelog data for 2024.

## Character Encoding Issues

**Observation**: Several procedure descriptions contain character encoding issues.

**Example**: 
- D0210: "intraoral ΓÇô comprehensive series of radiographic images"
- D6056: "prefabricated abutment ΓÇô includes modification and placement"

**Impact**: Affects readability of procedure descriptions in reports and user interfaces.

**Recommendation**: Fix character encoding in the procedurecode table for affected descriptions, replacing "ΓÇô" with proper hyphens or em-dashes.

## Extreme Fee Values

**Observation**: Some procedures have unusually high fees, with a maximum of $25,500.

**Impact**: May skew fee analysis and payment metrics. Could represent either high-value specialized procedures or potential data entry errors.

**Recommendation**: Verify procedures with fees above $5,000 to confirm accuracy.

## Broken Appointments

**Observation**: 657 procedures (approximately 3.4% of procedures with appointments) are associated with broken appointments.

**Impact**: May affect analysis of procedure completion rates and scheduling efficiency.

**Recommendation**: Consider examining whether procedures linked to broken appointments have been rescheduled or completed at later dates.

## Payment Gap for Completed Procedures

**Observation**: Only 73.29% of completed procedures (14,187 out of 19,358) have received any payments, and the overall payment ratio for completed procedures is 80.3%. The success criteria achievement rate is only 62.84%.

**Impact**: This falls significantly below the target success threshold of 95%, suggesting potential issues with payment collection or recording.

**Recommendation**: Investigate unpaid completed procedures to determine if payments are missing, delayed, or if procedures should have a different status.

## Unpaid Completed Procedures

**Observation**: 2,234 completed procedures with fees (11.5% of all completed procedures) have received no payment at all, representing $598,497.50 in unbilled/uncollected revenue.

**Impact**: This represents a significant revenue gap and potential data quality issue.

**Recommendation**: Review these procedures to determine if they are genuinely complete, if payments are pending entry, or if there are systematic issues with payment processing.

## Underpaid Procedures

**Observation**: 790 completed procedures (2.11%) have received less than 50% of their fee, with only 28.47% average collection rate, representing $169,318.01 in potential lost revenue.

**Impact**: These partially-paid procedures indicate potential issues with insurance claims processing or patient collections.

**Recommendation**: Audit these procedures to identify patterns of underpayment by insurance carrier, procedure type, or provider.

## Overpayment Issues

**Observation**: 1,339 procedures (3.57%) received payments exceeding their fee amount, with 1,166 having significant overpayments (>105% of fee). The maximum payment ratio observed is 787.5% (7.875 times the procedure fee).

**Impact**: This represents $210,277.91 in excess payments that may indicate accounting errors, incorrect fee schedules, or potential compliance issues.

**Recommendation**: Review overpaid procedures to identify systematic causes and establish controls to prevent future occurrences, with special focus on extreme outliers exceeding 200% of expected fee.

## Binary Payment Pattern

**Observation**: Payment metrics show a strong binary pattern - procedures are either fully paid (69.49% in the 98-100%+ category) or completely unpaid (14.30%), with relatively few in partial payment categories.

**Impact**: This unusual distribution pattern may indicate either a highly effective collection process or systematic data quality issues in how payments are associated with procedures.

**Recommendation**: Validate the payment allocation process to confirm that payments are being correctly distributed across procedures rather than being artificially concentrated on specific procedures.

## Payment Processing Consistency

**Observation**: The average payment ratio for the 98-100%+ category is 105.92%, indicating consistent overpayment rather than occasional outliers.

**Impact**: This systematic overpayment suggests a potential mismatch between fee schedules and actual payment expectations.

**Recommendation**: Compare fee schedule amounts against expected insurance reimbursements to identify and adjust procedures with consistently misaligned fees.

## Monthly Pattern of Unpaid Procedures

**Observation**: While December has the highest count of unpaid procedures (339), there is a consistent pattern of unpaid procedures throughout the year, including early months (January: 155, February: 121, March: 147).

**Impact**: The presence of unpaid procedures across all months, not just recent ones, indicates systemic issues beyond normal billing cycles.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize investigation of unpaid procedures from January-June 2024, as these have aged beyond typical payment cycles and represent $300,353.50 in potential collectible revenue.

## Extreme Unpaid Fee Value Anomalies

**Observation**: Some months contain extremely high unpaid fee values that skew the distribution:
- April has an unpaid procedure fee of $17,500
- June has an unpaid procedure fee of $14,140
- October has two unpaid procedures of $9,000 each

**Impact**: These outliers represent over $49,640 in high-value uncollected revenue and may indicate special cases or data entry errors.

**Recommendation**: Investigate these specific high-value unpaid procedures as they may represent priority collection opportunities or data quality issues.

## Monthly Unpaid Fee Distribution

**Observation**: The distribution of unpaid fees varies significantly by month:
- March and April have the highest average unpaid fees ($406.12 and $560.31)
- September has the lowest average unpaid fee ($162.08)
- High-value procedure counts (≥$1,000) vary from 5-37 per month

**Impact**: These patterns suggest either data quality issues in certain months or potential seasonality in high-value procedure payment processing.

**Recommendation**: Compare monthly unpaid patterns against staffing changes, system updates, or operational changes that might explain these variations.

## High-Value Unpaid Concentration in March

**Observation**: March contains 37 high-value unpaid procedures (≥$1,000), more than twice the monthly average and representing 22.7% of all high-value unpaid procedures for the year.

**Impact**: This anomalous concentration suggests either a systemic issue specific to March or a possible batch processing failure.

**Recommendation**: Conduct detailed audit of March's high-value procedures to identify potential patterns in provider, procedure type, or insurance carrier that might explain this concentration.

## December Performance Anomaly

**Observation**: December shows a dramatic drop in payment performance metrics:
- 31.55% of completed procedures are unpaid (vs. ~10% in other months)
- Payment rate drops to 48.97% (vs. ~80-85% in previous months)
- Success rate falls to 34.01% (vs. ~60-70% in other months)

**Impact**: The December anomaly significantly affects overall annual metrics and suggests either processing delays or data quality issues.

**Recommendation**: Investigate whether this is due to end-of-year billing delays, claim processing backlog, or actual data quality issues that require correction.

## Seasonal Performance Variations

**Observation**: Analysis shows consistent seasonal patterns in procedure volume and payment performance:
- Q1 (Jan-Mar): Strong performance with gradual decline
- Q2 (Apr-Jun): Peak performance period (particularly June)
- Q3 (Jul-Sep): Stable with slight September dip
- Q4 (Oct-Dec): Volume spike in October followed by December collapse

**Impact**: These patterns affect revenue forecasting and operational planning if not accounted for.

**Recommendation**: Incorporate seasonal adjustments into performance metrics and establish different benchmarks for different times of year.

## Incomplete Time Series

**Observation**: Our analysis is limited to procedures and payments recorded in 2024, excluding any payment activity from January/February 2025 that might apply to late-2024 procedures.

**Impact**: This timing limitation may artificially depress payment metrics for procedures performed in late 2024, particularly December.

**Recommendation**: Re-run analysis in Q2 2025 to capture delayed payments for Q4 2024 procedures and establish a more accurate year-end performance baseline.
