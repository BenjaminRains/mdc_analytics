# ProcedureLog Data Quality Observations

This document records data quality observations identified during validation of the procedurelog data for 2024.

## Character Encoding Issues

**Observation**: Several procedure descriptions contain character encoding issues.

**Example**: 
- D0210: "intraoral ΓÇô comprehensive series of radiographic images"
- D6056: "prefabricated abutment ΓÇô includes modification and placement"

**Impact**: Affects readability of procedure descriptions in reports and user interfaces.

**Recommendation**: Fix character encoding in the procedurecode table for affected descriptions, replacing "ΓÇô" with proper hyphens or em-dashes.

## Extreme Fee Values

**Observation**: Some procedures have unusually high fees, with a maximum of $25,500.

**Impact**: May skew fee analysis and payment metrics. Could represent either high-value specialized procedures or potential data entry errors.

**Recommendation**: Verify procedures with fees above $5,000 to confirm accuracy.

## Broken Appointments

**Observation**: 657 procedures (approximately 3.4% of procedures with appointments) are associated with broken appointments.

**Impact**: May affect analysis of procedure completion rates and scheduling efficiency.

**Recommendation**: Consider examining whether procedures linked to broken appointments have been rescheduled or completed at later dates.

## Payment Gap for Completed Procedures

**Observation**: Only 73.29% of completed procedures (14,187 out of 19,358) have received any payments, and the overall payment ratio for completed procedures is 80.3%. The success criteria achievement rate is only 62.84%.

**Impact**: This falls significantly below the target success threshold of 95%, suggesting potential issues with payment collection or recording.

**Recommendation**: Investigate unpaid completed procedures to determine if payments are missing, delayed, or if procedures should have a different status.

## Unpaid Completed Procedures

**Observation**: 2,234 completed procedures with fees (11.5% of all completed procedures) have received no payment at all, representing $598,497.50 in unbilled/uncollected revenue.

**Impact**: This represents a significant revenue gap and potential data quality issue.

**Recommendation**: Review these procedures to determine if they are genuinely complete, if payments are pending entry, or if there are systematic issues with payment processing.

## Underpaid Procedures

**Observation**: 790 completed procedures (2.11%) have received less than 50% of their fee, with only 28.47% average collection rate, representing $169,318.01 in potential lost revenue.

**Impact**: These partially-paid procedures indicate potential issues with insurance claims processing or patient collections.

**Recommendation**: Audit these procedures to identify patterns of underpayment by insurance carrier, procedure type, or provider.

## Overpayment Issues

**Observation**: 1,339 procedures (3.57%) received payments exceeding their fee amount, with 1,166 having significant overpayments (>105% of fee). The maximum payment ratio observed is 787.5% (7.875 times the procedure fee).

**Impact**: This represents $210,277.91 in excess payments that may indicate accounting errors, incorrect fee schedules, or potential compliance issues.

**Recommendation**: Review overpaid procedures to identify systematic causes and establish controls to prevent future occurrences, with special focus on extreme outliers exceeding 200% of expected fee.

## Binary Payment Pattern

**Observation**: Payment metrics show a strong binary pattern - procedures are either fully paid (69.49% in the 98-100%+ category) or completely unpaid (14.30%), with relatively few in partial payment categories.

**Impact**: This unusual distribution pattern may indicate either a highly effective collection process or systematic data quality issues in how payments are associated with procedures.

**Recommendation**: Validate the payment allocation process to confirm that payments are being correctly distributed across procedures rather than being artificially concentrated on specific procedures.

## Payment Processing Consistency

**Observation**: The average payment ratio for the 98-100%+ category is 105.92%, indicating consistent overpayment rather than occasional outliers.

**Impact**: This systematic overpayment suggests a potential mismatch between fee schedules and actual payment expectations.

**Recommendation**: Compare fee schedule amounts against expected insurance reimbursements to identify and adjust procedures with consistently misaligned fees.

## Monthly Pattern of Unpaid Procedures

**Observation**: While December has the highest count of unpaid procedures (339), there is a consistent pattern of unpaid procedures throughout the year, including early months (January: 155, February: 121, March: 147).

**Impact**: The presence of unpaid procedures across all months, not just recent ones, indicates systemic issues beyond normal billing cycles.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize investigation of unpaid procedures from January-June 2024, as these have aged beyond typical payment cycles and represent $300,353.50 in potential collectible revenue.

## Extreme Unpaid Fee Value Anomalies

**Observation**: Some months contain extremely high unpaid fee values that skew the distribution:
- April has an unpaid procedure fee of $17,500
- June has an unpaid procedure fee of $14,140
- October has two unpaid procedures of $9,000 each

**Impact**: These outliers represent over $49,640 in high-value uncollected revenue and may indicate special cases or data entry errors.

**Recommendation**: Investigate these specific high-value unpaid procedures as they may represent priority collection opportunities or data quality issues.

## Monthly Unpaid Fee Distribution

**Observation**: The distribution of unpaid fees varies significantly by month:
- March and April have the highest average unpaid fees ($406.12 and $560.31)
- September has the lowest average unpaid fee ($162.08)
- High-value procedure counts (≥$1,000) vary from 5-37 per month

**Impact**: These patterns suggest either data quality issues in certain months or potential seasonality in high-value procedure payment processing.

**Recommendation**: Compare monthly unpaid patterns against staffing changes, system updates, or operational changes that might explain these variations.

## High-Value Unpaid Concentration in March

**Observation**: March contains 37 high-value unpaid procedures (≥$1,000), more than twice the monthly average and representing 22.7% of all high-value unpaid procedures for the year.

**Impact**: This anomalous concentration suggests either a systemic issue specific to March or a possible batch processing failure.

**Recommendation**: Conduct detailed audit of March's high-value procedures to identify potential patterns in provider, procedure type, or insurance carrier that might explain this concentration.

## December Performance Anomaly

**Observation**: December shows a dramatic drop in payment performance metrics:
- 31.55% of completed procedures are unpaid (vs. ~10% in other months)
- Payment rate drops to 48.97% (vs. ~80-85% in previous months)
- Success rate falls to 34.01% (vs. ~60-70% in other months)

**Impact**: The December anomaly significantly affects overall annual metrics and suggests either processing delays or data quality issues.

**Recommendation**: Investigate whether this is due to end-of-year billing delays, claim processing backlog, or actual data quality issues that require correction.

## Seasonal Performance Variations

**Observation**: Analysis shows consistent seasonal patterns in procedure volume and payment performance:
- Q1 (Jan-Mar): Strong performance with gradual decline
- Q2 (Apr-Jun): Peak performance period (particularly June)
- Q3 (Jul-Sep): Stable with slight September dip
- Q4 (Oct-Dec): Volume spike in October followed by December collapse

**Impact**: These patterns affect revenue forecasting and operational planning if not accounted for.

**Recommendation**: Incorporate seasonal adjustments into performance metrics and establish different benchmarks for different times of year.

## Incomplete Time Series

**Observation**: Our analysis is limited to procedures and payments recorded in 2024, excluding any payment activity from January/February 2025 that might apply to late-2024 procedures.

**Impact**: This timing limitation may artificially depress payment metrics for procedures performed in late 2024, particularly December.

**Recommendation**: Re-run analysis in Q2 2025 to capture delayed payments for Q4 2024 procedures and establish a more accurate year-end performance baseline.

## Payment Linkage Timing Anomalies

**Observation**: Payment linkage timing analysis shows extreme days-to-payment values:
- Direct payment partially paid: 2,916 days average (nearly 8 years)
- Mixed payment partially paid: 3,283 days average (9+ years)
- Direct payment fully paid: 1,021 days average (2.8 years)

**Impact**: These extreme values suggest either historical data being processed or serious timing issues in payment application. They distort payment efficiency analytics and make it impossible to evaluate true payment cycle time.

**Recommendation**: Investigate payment date accuracy, particularly for procedures showing payment dates more than 1 year from completion date, and establish data validation rules to prevent future anomalies.

## Mixed Payment Source Overpayment

**Observation**: Procedures with mixed payment sources show a payment rate of 123.6%, significantly exceeding the expected 100% and higher than all other payment source categories.

**Impact**: This systematic overpayment suggests either duplicate payments or improper payment allocation when multiple sources are involved. This represents a potential compliance risk and accounting discrepancy.

**Recommendation**: Audit mixed-source payment allocation process to identify whether overpayments result from failure to adjust fee amounts, double-counting of payments, or legitimate additional payments that should be recorded differently.

## Insurance Payment Record Anomalies

**Observation**: 5,766 procedures have insurance records (claimproc entries) but zero insurance payments, representing 24.41% of all procedures. Additionally, 2,602 fully paid procedures with mixed sources have zero insurance payments despite having insurance records.

**Impact**: This pattern suggests potential issues with insurance claim processing, payment recording, or system data integration between insurance and payment modules.

**Recommendation**: Investigate whether these represent denied claims, pending claims, or data entry issues. Create an audit process to reconcile insurance claims with payment records.

## Negative Payment Values

**Observation**: Some procedures in the "Mixed payment sources/Unpaid" category show negative total payment values (-35.0).

**Impact**: Negative payments suggest either refunds or accounting adjustments that aren't being properly categorized, potentially distorting financial reporting.

**Recommendation**: Create a separate category for negative payment transactions and implement validation to ensure they're properly documented with reason codes.
