# ProcedureLog Data Quality Observations

This document records data quality observations identified during validation of the procedurelog data for 2024.

## Character Encoding Issues

**Observation**: Several procedure descriptions contain character encoding issues.

**Example**: 
- D0210: "intraoral ΓÇô comprehensive series of radiographic images"
- D6056: "prefabricated abutment ΓÇô includes modification and placement"

**Impact**: Affects readability of procedure descriptions in reports and user interfaces.

**Recommendation**: Fix character encoding in the procedurecode table for affected descriptions, replacing "ΓÇô" with proper hyphens or em-dashes.

## Extreme Fee Values

**Observation**: Some procedures have unusually high fees, with a maximum of $25,500.

**Impact**: May skew fee analysis and payment metrics. Could represent either high-value specialized procedures or potential data entry errors.

**Recommendation**: Verify procedures with fees above $5,000 to confirm accuracy.

## Broken Appointments

**Observation**: 657 procedures (approximately 3.4% of procedures with appointments) are associated with broken appointments.

**Impact**: May affect analysis of procedure completion rates and scheduling efficiency.

**Recommendation**: Consider examining whether procedures linked to broken appointments have been rescheduled or completed at later dates.

## Payment Gap for Completed Procedures

**Observation**: Only 73.29% of completed procedures (14,187 out of 19,358) have received any payments, and the overall payment ratio for completed procedures is 80.3%. The success criteria achievement rate is only 62.84%.

**Impact**: This falls significantly below the target success threshold of 95%, suggesting potential issues with payment collection or recording.

**Recommendation**: Investigate unpaid completed procedures to determine if payments are missing, delayed, or if procedures should have a different status.

## Unpaid Completed Procedures

**Observation**: 2,234 completed procedures with fees (11.5% of all completed procedures) have received no payment at all, representing $598,497.50 in unbilled/uncollected revenue.

**Impact**: This represents a significant revenue gap and potential data quality issue.

**Recommendation**: Review these procedures to determine if they are genuinely complete, if payments are pending entry, or if there are systematic issues with payment processing.

## Underpaid Procedures

**Observation**: 790 completed procedures (2.11%) have received less than 50% of their fee, with only 28.47% average collection rate, representing $169,318.01 in potential lost revenue.

**Impact**: These partially-paid procedures indicate potential issues with insurance claims processing or patient collections.

**Recommendation**: Audit these procedures to identify patterns of underpayment by insurance carrier, procedure type, or provider.

## Overpayment Issues

**Observation**: 1,339 procedures (3.57%) received payments exceeding their fee amount, with 1,166 having significant overpayments (>105% of fee).

**Impact**: This represents $210,277.91 in excess payments that may indicate accounting errors, incorrect fee schedules, or potential compliance issues.

**Recommendation**: Review overpaid procedures to identify systematic causes and establish controls to prevent future occurrences.

## Monthly Pattern of Unpaid Procedures

**Observation**: While December has the highest count of unpaid procedures (448), there is a consistent pattern of unpaid procedures throughout the year, including early months (January: 172, February: 139, March: 161).

**Impact**: The presence of unpaid procedures across all months, not just recent ones, indicates systemic issues beyond normal billing cycles.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize investigation of unpaid procedures from January-June 2024, as these have aged beyond typical payment cycles and represent $314,742.50 in potential collectible revenue.

## Data Timing Limitation

**Observation**: Our analysis is limited to procedures and payments recorded in 2024, excluding any payment activity from January/February
