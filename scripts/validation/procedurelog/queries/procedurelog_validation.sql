/*
 * Comprehensive Procedure Log Validation Query
 * 
 * Purpose: Analyze procedure records across multiple dimensions for the year 2024
 * 
 * Output Structure:
 * - OutputSection: Analysis category identifier
 * - GroupLabel: Context-specific grouping key
 * - Metrics 1-7: Section-specific measurements
 * 
 * Analysis Sections:
 * 1. Overall ProcStatus Distribution
 * 2. Missed/Cancelled Appointment Analysis
 * 3. Detailed Status Analysis
 * 4. Appointment Status Overlap Analysis
 * 5. Temporal Analysis
 * 6. Multiple Recording Pattern Analysis
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - All date ranges: 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31
 * - Missed/Cancelled codes: D9986 (Missed), D9987 (Cancelled)
 * - AptStatus = 5 represents broken appointments
 * - ProcStatus values: 1=Treatment Planned, 2=Completed, 3=Existing Current, 
 *   4=Existing Other, 5=Referred, 6=Deleted, 7=Condition, 8=Invalid
 * - Payment Types: 0=Regular, 288=Prepayment, 439=Treatment Plan Deposit
 * - Success criteria: Payment ratio â‰¥ 0.95 or zero-fee (excluding admin codes)
