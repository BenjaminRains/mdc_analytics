# Key Treatment Journey ML Analysis Questions

These prioritized questions represent the most impactful areas for analysis using the treatment_journey_ml dataset.

## Treatment Acceptance & Financial Patterns

1. **Treatment Plan Acceptance**
   - What combination of factors best predicts full vs. partial treatment plan acceptance?
   - How do payment history, insurance status, and procedure complexity interact to influence acceptance?

2. **Financial Risk Assessment**
   - Can we predict likelihood of payment default within 30/60/90 days?
   - What patterns indicate potential financial barriers before treatment presentation?

3. **Family Influence**
   - How do family procedure and payment histories affect individual treatment decisions?
   - What is the correlation between family size, financial history, and treatment acceptance?

## Patient Engagement & Communication

4. **Communication Effectiveness**
   - Which combination of communication method, timing, and frequency maximizes treatment acceptance?
   - How does recent communication activity correlate with payment behavior?

5. **Patient Journey Mapping**
   - What appointment patterns indicate risk of treatment plan abandonment?
   - How does the time between treatment planning and completion affect success rates?

## Predictive Risk Models

6. **Treatment Success Prediction**
   - What patient characteristics and behaviors predict long-term treatment success?
   - How accurately can we identify high-risk patients for treatment abandonment?

7. **Appointment Risk**
   - What factors best predict likelihood of missed appointments?
   - How do missed appointments correlate with future treatment acceptance?

## Operational Optimization

8. **Scheduling Optimization**
   - What scheduling patterns maximize treatment acceptance and completion?
   - How does provider time allocation affect treatment success rates?

9. **Resource Allocation**
   - Which patients are most likely to need additional support or follow-up?
   - How can we optimize communication resources based on patient risk profiles?

## Long-term Success Factors

10. **Patient Retention**
    - What combination of factors predicts long-term patient retention?
    - How does early treatment experience affect long-term engagement?

Note: These questions focus on actionable insights that can directly improve patient care and practice operations. Each question may require different modeling approaches and feature engineering strategies.
