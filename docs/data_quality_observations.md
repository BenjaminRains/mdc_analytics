# Data Quality Observations

This document tracks notable data patterns, inconsistencies, and outliers discovered during analysis. These observations help understand the data quality and potential edge cases.

## Appointments

### Broken Appointments with Completed Procedures

**Context:**
- Total broken appointments (AptStatus = 5): 8,041
- Broken appointments with completed procedures: 3 (0.037%)

**Observations:**
1. Clinical Procedure Case:
   - 1 case of a resin-based composite procedure
   - Appointment date: 2018-11-30
   - Completed date: 2021-04-26 (878 days later)
   - Likely represents a patient who missed the original appointment but returned much later

2. Administrative Procedure Cases:
   - 2 cases of "Delivery" procedures
   - Completed 35-135 days after the broken appointments
   - Notes suggest these are paperwork/documentation related
   - Example notes: "EMAILED UPDATED PAPERWORK"

**Assessment:**
These cases appear to be legitimate outliers rather than data quality issues:
- The clinical case likely represents a rescheduled procedure
- The administrative cases appear to be documentation tasks completed despite missed appointments
- The extremely low percentage (0.037%) suggests these are exceptional cases rather than systematic issues

## Appointment Status Distribution

Status counts across all appointments:
1. Status 1 (Scheduled): 1,666
2. Status 2 (Completed): 63,961
3. Status 3 (Unspecified): 2,623
4. Status 4 (ASAP): 4,325
5. Status 5 (Broken/Missed): 3,695
6. Status 6 (Unscheduled): 1

## Missing Teeth Analysis

### Data Quality and Distribution

**Context:**
- Total patients with missing teeth: 3,957
- Patients with anterior teeth missing: 1,185 (29.9%)
- Patients with first molars missing: Not directly reported

**Treatment Categories Distribution:**
1. Multiple Implant Candidate: 1,279 (32.3%)
2. Single Tooth Implant Candidate: 953 (24.1%)
3. Full Arch Implant Candidate: 867 (21.9%)
4. All-on-4/6 Candidate: 765 (19.3%)
5. Anterior Bridge/Implant Candidate: 93 (2.4%)

**Data Quality Observations:**
1. Tooth Number Format Issues:
   - Found instances of OCR-like errors in tooth numbers
   - Common substitutions: 'O'/'o' for '0', 'l'/'I'/'i' for '1'
   - Required data cleaning to standardize numeric format
   - Example: "O8" → "08", "l4" → "14"

2. Validation Rules:
   - Excluded wisdom teeth (1,16,17,32) from analysis
   - Filtered out invalid tooth numbers
   - Required numeric values between 2-15 and 18-31

3. Pattern Analysis:
   - Most common: 2-4 missing teeth (32.3%)
   - Significant number of full arch cases (41.2% combined Full Arch and All-on-4/6)
   - Relatively low number of anterior-only cases (2.4%)

**Assessment:**
- Data quality issues appear to be primarily input/OCR related
- After cleaning, the distribution of cases aligns with clinical expectations
- High percentage of multiple tooth cases suggests focus needed on comprehensive treatment planning
