KPI Name: Total AR Current
KPI Long Name: Total AR Current

Description
Total AR Current refers to the total amount of outstanding receivables that are not past due. This metric is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of the billing and collections processes in the dental office.

Purpose: To measure the efficiency in collecting payments within the expected time period.
Importance: Understanding Total AR Current helps in maintaining a healthy cash flow and identifying any potential issues in the billing cycle.
Calculation
Total AR Current is calculated by summing up all the receivable amounts that are not due yet. This means you only add the amounts that patients or insurance companies owe but the payment deadline has not passed.

Simple Math: If Patient A owes $100 and is not due yet, Patient B owes $200 and is not due yet, and Patient C owes $150 and is past due, your Total AR Current is $100 + $200 = $300.

Keeping the Total AR Current as high as possible is an indicator that the office effectively collects payments on time, thereby improving overall financial health.

KPI Name
Total AR 30-60

KPI Long Name
Total AR 30-60

KPI Description
This KPI measures the total amount of accounts receivable (AR) that are overdue for a period of 30 to 60 days. It helps the dental office track outstanding payments and manage cash flow more effectively.

Time Frame: 30 to 60 days overdue
Purpose: To identify and manage the overdue receivables
Importance: Ensures that overdue accounts are addressed promptly to maintain a healthy cash flow
KPI Calculation
To calculate Total AR 30-60, follow these steps:

Identify all accounts receivable that are overdue by 30 to 60 days.
Add up the amounts of these overdue accounts.
The sum of these amounts will give you the Total AR 30-60.

For example, if you have three overdue invoices: $200 (31 days overdue), $150 (45 days overdue), and $100 (55 days overdue), your Total AR 30-60 would be calculated as:

$200 + $150 + $100 = $450
So, the Total AR 30-60 is $450.

This KPI helps maintain transparency and prioritize collection efforts, ultimately supporting the financial health of the dental office.

Total AR 60-90
Total AR 60-90

KPI Description
Total AR 60-90 is a measure of the total accounts receivable amounts that are aged between 60 and 90 days. This KPI helps dental offices track the status of payments that are overdue within this specific time frame, which can impact cash flow and financial planning.

Age Range: 60-90 days
Purpose: Monitor overdue payments to ensure timely collection and improve financial management.
Impact: Helps in identifying patterns in payment delays and can guide strategies to improve the collection process.
Calculation
To calculate Total AR 60-90:

Identify all outstanding invoices that are aged between 60 and 90 days.
Add up the amounts of these invoices.
For example, if you have three invoices aged 60-90 days with amounts of $100, $200, and $300 respectively, the Total AR 60-90 would be:

$100 + $200 + $300 = $600

Maintaining a low Total AR 60-90 is crucial for a dental office's financial health as it ensures that payments are being collected in a timely manner, thus improving cash flow and reducing potential bad debts.

KPI Name: Total AR Over 90
The Total AR Over 90 KPI tracks the total amount of accounts receivable that are overdue by more than 90 days.

Details
This KPI is crucial for understanding the long-term outstanding payments from patients and insurance companies. It helps the dental office gauge the effectiveness of their billing and collections processes.

Importance: High
Frequency of Measurement: Monthly
Target Audience: Office Managers, Billing Department
Calculation in Simple Math
To calculate the Total AR Over 90, follow these steps:

Add up all the individual invoices that are overdue by more than 90 days. For example, if there are three overdue invoices of $150, $200, and $250, you would add 150 + 200 + 250.
The result of this addition is the Total AR Over 90.
Formula: Total AR Over 90 = Sum of all invoices overdue by more than 90 days.

Monitoring the Total AR Over 90 allows the dental office to identify persistent payment issues and take corrective actions such as following up with patients or adjusting billing practices.

KPI Name
Total AR Current %

KPI Long Name
Total AR Current %

Description: The Total AR (Accounts Receivable) Current % measures the percentage of the total accounts receivable that are currently within the acceptable period for payment. This KPI helps the dental office understand how much of their receivables are being paid in a timely manner.
Calculation
To calculate the Total AR Current %, you can use the following simple math:

Step 1: Identify the total amount of current receivables (those within the acceptable payment period).
Step 2: Identify the total accounts receivable.
Step 3: Divide the total current receivables by the total accounts receivable.
Step 4: Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.
For example, if the dental office has $10,000 in current receivables and $20,000 in total receivables, the calculation would be:

Current Receivables: $10,000
Total Receivables: $20,000
Step 3: $10,000 / $20,000 = 0.5
Step 4: 0.5 * 100 = 50%
So, the Total AR Current % is 50%.

Monitoring the Total AR Current % helps ensure that the dental office maintains a healthy cash flow by maximizing the amount of receivables collected within the acceptable period.

KPI Name: Total AR 30-60 %
KPI Long Name: Total AR 30-60 %

Description
This KPI measures the percentage of the total accounts receivable (AR) that are overdue between 30 to 60 days. In other words, it helps the dental office understand how much of the money that is expected to be received from patients or insurance companies has not been paid within 30 to 60 days after the billing date.

Indicator: Financial Health
Time Frame: 30 to 60 Days Past Due
Importance: Medium
Calculation
The Total AR 30-60 % is calculated using the following formula:

(Total AR 30-60 Days / Total AR) * 100

Total AR 30-60 Days: Sum of all receivables that are past due between 30 and 60 days.
Total AR: Sum of all receivables, regardless of their age.
For a simple example, if the dental office has $10,000 in total accounts receivable, and $2,500 of that amount is overdue between 30 and 60 days, the calculation would be:

(2,500 / 10,000) * 100 = 25%

This means 25% of the total accounts receivable are overdue between 30 and 60 days.

Monitoring the Total AR 30-60 % KPI helps the dental office manage its cash flow effectively and take timely actions to collect overdue payments, ensuring financial stability and health.
